I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), a member of [LUKA Group](https://luka-group.github.io/index.html).
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/).
Before that, I received my Master degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2025 and my Bachelor degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing and Multimodality, focusing on **Reasoning**, **Planning**, and **Agent** across different modalities.

<!-- My recent works can be summarized as: -->

<!-- - **X = Algorithm**: [Deductive Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17686).
- **X = Vision**: [Visual Taxonomy Expansion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3613845).
- **X = Agents**: [Travel Planner](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/TravelPlanner/). -->

Besides research, I enjoy swimming🏊‍♂️, basketball🏀, bowling🎳, tennis🎾 and piano🎹.
