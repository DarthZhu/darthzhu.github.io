I am a first year Master student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). I am a member of [Knowledge Works Research Laboratory](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/) and is supervised by Prof. [Yanghua Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ). I received my BS CS degree in 2022 from Fudan University. During my undergraduate years, I've been working with Prof. [Yanghua Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ).

## Research Interests

My research interests are broadly in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Currently, my interests focus on exploring the capabilities of large language models and their applications. My recent works can be summarize as:

- **LLMs as agents**, especially facilitating language models to solve complicated crossword puzzles requiring world knowledge and reasoning abilities.
- **Commonsense distillation**, especially hypernymy detection.
- **Knowledge graph completion**, including entity linking, taxonomy expansion and taxonomy construction.
<!-- - **Symbolic reasoning with LLM**, still trying to understand the relation between the reasoning abilities of LLM and symbolic reasoning like first order logic. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
