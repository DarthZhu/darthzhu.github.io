<!-- Also, I interned at Meituan NLP Group -->

<!-- My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing, focusing on **Language + X**, where **X** $$ \in $$ {Vision, Algorithms, Agents ...}.
My recent works can be summarized as: -->

My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing and Multimodality, focusing on **Reasoning**, **Planning**, and **RAG** across different modalities.

<!-- My recent works can be summarized as: -->

<!-- - **X = Algorithm**: [Deductive Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17686).
- **X = Vision**: [Visual Taxonomy Expansion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3613845).
- **X = Agents**: [Travel Planner](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/TravelPlanner/). -->

Besides research, I enjoy swimming🏊‍♂️, basketball🏀, bowling🎳, tennis🎾 and piano🎹.
