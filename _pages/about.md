I am a second year Master student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), a member of [Knowledge Works Research Laboratory](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof.
[Yanghua Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ).
Currently, I am a research intern at [OSU NLP group](https://twitter.com/osunlp), supervised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/).

<!-- Also, I was a research intern at [OSU NLP group](https://twitter.com/osunlp), supervised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/).
Currently, I am a research intern at [LUKA Group](https://luka-group.github.io/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/). -->

My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing, focusing on **Language + X**, where **X** $$ \in $$ {Vision, Algorithms, Agents ...}.
My recent works can be summarized as:

- **X = Algorithm**: [Deductive Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17686).
- **X = Vision**: [Visual Taxonomy Expansion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3613845).
- **X = Agents**: [Travel Planner](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/TravelPlanner/).

Besides research, I enjoy swimming🏊‍♂️, basketball🏀, bowling🎳, tennis🎾 and piano🎹.
